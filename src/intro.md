# The Duckietown Operation Manual

This document describes the Duckietown appearance specification and provides assembly instructions. 
Specifications are a set of rules for which a functional system has been verified. 
This means that if these rules are followed while building a Duckietown, Duckiebots will work as expected.

Any Duckietown not adhering to the rules described here cannot be considered a Duckietown, 
and may cause the Duckiebots operating within them to fail in (possibly spectacularly) unexpected ways.

Small perturbations to the appearance specifications might affect negatively the performance of Duckiebots, 
although most algorithms are robust to variations.
