# Non-functional elements


The citizens of Duckietown like their cities to be colorful and fun, and encourage all efforts at adding non-functional components to the city, such as decorative buildings, colored felts to simulate grass or bodies of water, and any contraption that would please the population.

Non-functional objects like decorative buildings, sit on the floor layer of empty tiles. 

```{caution}
Make sure the placement of your decorations does not interfere with the road and signals layers.
```

Moreover, although Duckiebot drivers all have their driving licenses and know to focus on the road, the _background_, i.e., whatever is in the room the Duckietown was assembled, matters too.
