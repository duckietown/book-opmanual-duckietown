# Layer - Traffic Lights

The assembly procedure for building traffic lights can be found in [](traffic-light-assembly-18).

## Placement

The lights must be at a height of 20 cm above the center of the intersection tile.

The computational stack of the traffic light should be mounted in the appropriate housing outside 
the allowable driving region. The cabling should be housed in the appropriate structure as detailed 
in [](traffic-light-assembly-18). The traffic light pillar stands should be positioned in such a way 
that the embedded traffic sign stands respect the above specifications for traffic light stands.
