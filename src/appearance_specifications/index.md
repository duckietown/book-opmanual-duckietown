# Introduction

Functionally, Duckietown cities are an integral part of the robotic ecosystem we call Duckietown.

Duckietown cities are designed to communicate information to the Duckiebots, so these can operate
effectively.

Duckietown cities are *modular*, i.e., they are composed of fundamental building blocks that 
can be combined to create nearly arbitrary city landscapes.

Duckietown cities are built in layers. Each layer sends information of increasing complexity 
to the robots operating in it. The layers are, namely, the: *floor*, *signals*, and 
*smart infrastructure* layers. "Non-functional" elements compliment the construction of every Duckietown.
