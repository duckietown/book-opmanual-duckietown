# Decorations

The citizens of Duckietown like their cities to be colorful and fun, 
and encourage all efforts at adding non-functional components to the city, 
such as decorative buildings, colored felts to simulate grass or bodies of water, 
and any contraption that would please the population.

Non-functional objects like decorative buildings, sit on the floor layer of empty tiles.

```{caution}
Make sure the placement of your decorations does not interfere with the road and signals layers.
```

Moreover, although Duckiebot drivers all have their driving licenses and know to focus 
on the road, the _background_, i.e., whatever is in the room the Duckietown was assembled, 
matters too.
