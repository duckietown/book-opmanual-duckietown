# Infrastructure Layer

The infrastructure layer is made of 
[traffic lights](specs-layer-traffic-lights) and **watchtowers**.

```{todo}
Add link to **watchtower** above. 
```

Infrastructure elements sit on the floor layer, outside the lanes, and interact with the 
Duckiebots in town.

Traffic lights and watchtowers are proper robots: they have computation, sensing, 
memory and actuation capabilities. As such, they can be programmed to exhibit behaviors, 
including communication with other agents.

The most fundamental behavior of a traffic light is to signal (stop and go) to the 
Duckiebots at intersections.

The most fundamental behavior of watchtowers is to localize Duckiebots and communicate 
their position to other agents. A network of watchtowers is the first step to building a 
**Duckietown Autolab**.

```{todo}
Add link to **Duckietown Autolab** above. 
```

```{todo}
add pictures of traffic light and watchtower
```

```{todo}
add picture with example positioning of both
```

```{todo}
add link to Autolab operation manual
```
